      <p>This is introduction about myself.I will share a little bit about myself and i will share information about course that i take in university.Welcome to My Website</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>My name is Nur Najiha Amyra Binti Zamri. I'm from Selangor.This year in June I will be entering the age of 20 years and right now i am in the final semester for my diploma.My education start from kindergarden, primary school, secondary school and 
      entering the realm of the university.I took a courses at UiTM which isi in Kedah for my Diploma. This course code is IM120 which the name of course is Diploma in Library Management. After this,I will explain more detail about this course.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>This library managemenet diploma course has 4 semesters. This course is under the Faculty of Information Management(IM)together with the information management course. Each semester, students will take at least 8 or 9 subjects inculding co-curriculum. 
      While in semester 3, student have to meet the requirements to pass this diploma, which is to undergo Practical Training for 6 or 8 weeks depending on the conditions of the semester at that time. The practical place, we can choose where we want to undergo 
      the Practical Training but have to wait whether the selected library accepts the practical training students or not. In addition, there are various things students learn through this course such as library history, types of libraries, social media, 
      types of information management agencies and many more in line with the passage of increasingly sophisticated times that can be associated with information agencies such as libraries. Students also in semester 2 learned to use adobe for the 2 subjects and      
      among the adobe used were photoshop, illustrator, premiere, and indesign. That was a new thing for us as a student and in semester 4 also learning about HTML which was a new and exciting thing to learn.That's a little bit about this course.</p>
